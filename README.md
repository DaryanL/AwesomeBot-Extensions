# AwesomeBot-Extensions

The repository serves as a gallery for community-built extensions for [AwesomeBot](http://awesomebot.xyz/).

Submit extensions by making a pull request with a Javascript file with the code for your extension. There should be a comment block at the top of the extension specifying the name, type, and key as well as interval, usage, extended help, and case (depending on type). Use [this](https://github.com/BitQuote/AwesomeBot-Extensions/blob/master/rip.js) as an example and read the [extensions wiki page](https://github.com/BitQuote/AwesomeBot/wiki/Extensions) for more information. Make sure the extension you submit hasn't already been added and is not specific to a single server. Thanks for your contributions!
